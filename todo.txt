I'm having trouble with IPA characters displaying correctly in the Replit code editor. When I type or paste IPA symbols (such as /Êƒ/) directly into my code, they appear as boxes or empty squares. This is happening within the code editor itself, not just in the console output. I've tried this with text and JavaScript files, and the issue persists. I expect to see the actual IPA characters in the code.
