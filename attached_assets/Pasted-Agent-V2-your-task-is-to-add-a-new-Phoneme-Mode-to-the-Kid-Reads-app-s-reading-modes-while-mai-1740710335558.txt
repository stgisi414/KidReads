Agent V2, your task is to **add a new "Phoneme Mode" to the Kid Reads app's reading modes, while maintaining the existing "Sentence Mode" and "Word Mode."**

**Deliverable:**

A functional Kid Reads app with three reading modes: "Sentence Mode," "Word Mode," and the new "Phoneme Mode."  All reading mode buttons should retain their existing emojis and text labels, with a new button added for "Phoneme Mode."

**Task: Implement the "Phoneme Mode" with the following specifications:**

1.  **Phoneme Breakdown using Gemini API:**
    *   Utilize the Gemini API to process the entire story text.
    *   For each word in the story text, use the Gemini API to generate a phoneme breakdown.
    *   The phoneme breakdown should represent each word as an array of phonemes.
    *   Example: The word "seat" should be represented as `["s", "ea", "t"]`.

2.  **Multi-Dimensional Nested Array Structure:**
    *   Organize the phoneme breakdowns for the entire story text into a multi-dimensional nested array.
    *   The structure should clearly associate each word in the story with its corresponding phoneme array.  Consider how this array will be used to drive the highlighting in "Phoneme Mode."

3.  **Integration into Reading Modes:**
    *   Create a new "Phoneme Mode" button in the reading mode selection interface. Ensure this button includes an appropriate emoji and text label, consistent with the existing "Sentence Mode" and "Word Mode" buttons.
    *   When "Phoneme Mode" is activated, the app should use the generated phoneme array to highlight the text.  *(Please clarify how you envision the highlighting to work in Phoneme Mode. Will it highlight phoneme by phoneme as the audio plays?)*

4.  **Maintain Existing Modes:**
    *   Ensure that the existing "Sentence Mode" and "Word Mode" continue to function correctly and without any regressions after adding the "Phoneme Mode."
    *   Do not alter the functionality or appearance of the "Sentence Mode" and "Word Mode" buttons, except for ensuring they coexist with the new "Phoneme Mode" button.

**Constraints and Considerations:**

*   **Gemini API Usage:** You are expected to use the Gemini API for the phoneme breakdown.  Ensure proper API calls and handling of responses.
*   **Data Structure:**  Design an efficient and accessible multi-dimensional nested array to store the phoneme data.
*   **User Interface:** Maintain a consistent user interface for reading mode selection, ensuring clarity and ease of use for children.
*   **Testing:** Thoroughly test all three reading modes ("Sentence," "Word," and "Phoneme") on different stories to ensure they function as expected and that the phoneme highlighting is accurate and helpful.

Please proceed with implementing the "Phoneme Mode" as described, focusing on accurate phoneme breakdown, proper data structure, seamless integration into the UI, and maintaining the existing reading modes.
